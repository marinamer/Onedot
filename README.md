# Data Task
In this repository you will find the finished Data Task for the Onedot Data Analyst selection process. 

## Requirements
In order to run the script you will need the following Python modules, which you can install by running the console commands below:
- openpyxl
    > $ pip install openpyxl
- XlsxWriter==1.4.4
    > $ pip install xlsxwriter
- numpy==1.20.3
    > $ pip install numpy
- pandas==1.2.4
    > $ pip install pandas

## Script
To run the script simply open your command-line console and write python (or python3 if you have both versions) followed by the path to the script

This script generates an Excel file with three tabs where you can see the different stages of this task, which will be stored in the same folder as the script: 
1) Pre-processing
2) Normalisation
3) Integration
